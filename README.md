### Redesign work of a people recruitment site.

Eventhough I wasn't asked to redesign Nederlia's site, once I was reached by one of their recruiters and had to visit the page to see what Nederlia was and to know some more about them. I found that it was not very direct and the way information was beign shown was not appealing to me, so I decided to give the page not just a simple facelift but a complete ux overhaul. [Here you can check the actual Nederila site](http://nederlia.com/){:target="_blank"} and [here is my proposal](https://staranco.github.io/nederlia-redesign/){:target="_blank"}.
